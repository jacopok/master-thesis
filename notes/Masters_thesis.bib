  abstract = {The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration have cataloged eleven confidently detected gravitational-wave events during the first two observing runs of the advanced detector era. All eleven events were consistent with being from well-modeled mergers between compact stellar-mass objects: black holes or neutron stars. The data around the time of each of these events have been made publicly available through the gravitational-wave open science center. The entirety of the gravitational-wave strain data from the first and second observing runs have also now been made publicly available. There is considerable interest among the broad scientific community in understanding the data and methods used in the analyses. In this paper, we provide an overview of the detector noise properties and the data analysis techniques used to detect gravitational-wave signals and infer the source properties. We describe some of the checks that are performed to validate the analyses and results from the observations of gravitational-wave events. We also address concerns that have been raised about various properties of LIGO–Virgo detector noise and the correctness of our analyses as applied to the resulting data.},

  abstract = {We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries. The two events are named GW200105\_162426 and GW200115\_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo and the second by all three LIGO–Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses and , whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses and (all measurements quoted at the 90\% credible level). The probability that the secondary’s mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89\%–96\% and 87\%–98\%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are and , respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90\% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88\% probability. We are unable to constrain the spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer an NSBH merger rate density of when assuming that GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population or under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm to generate application-specific, global reduced order quadratures (ROQ) for multiple fast evaluations of weighted inner products between parameterized functions. If a reduced basis or any other projection-based model reduction technique is applied, the dimensionality of integrands is reduced dramatically; however, the cost of approximating the integrands by projection still scales as the size of the original problem. In contrast, using discrete empirical interpolation points as ROQ nodes leads to a computational cost which depends linearly on the dimension of the reduced space. Generation of a reduced basis via a greedy procedure requires a training set, which for products of functions can be very large. Since this direct approach can be impractical in many applications, we propose instead a two-step greedy targeted towards approximation of such products. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and the efficiency of the two-step approach. The presented ROQ are expected to display very fast convergence whenever there is regularity with respect to parameter variation. We find that for the particular application here considered, one driven by gravitational wave physics, the two-step approach speeds up the offline computations to build the ROQ by more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the resulting ROQ rule is found to converge exponentially with the number of nodes, and a factor of \$\$\textbackslash sim \$\$50 savings, without loss of accuracy, is observed in evaluations of inner products when ROQ are used as a downsampling strategy for equidistant samples using the trapezoidal rule. While the primary focus of this paper is on quadrature rules for inner products of parameterized functions, our method can be easily adapted to integrations of single parameterized functions, and some examples of this type are considered.},

  abstract = {Merging compact binaries are currently regarded as the most promising source of gravitational waves for the planned Earth-based LIGO/VIRGO laser-interferometer detector system, and will be an important source also for similar, lower-frequency detectors that might be flown in space (e.g., the proposed LISA mission). During the orbital inspiral, if one or both bodies are rapidly rotating, the general relativistic spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling (i.e., the "dragging of inertial frames" by the bodies' spins) cause the binary's orbital plane to precess. In this paper we analyze the resulting modulation of the inspiral gravitational waveform, using post2-Newtonian equations to describe the precession of the orbital plane, but only the leading-order (Newtonian, quadrupole-moment approximation) equations to describe the orbit, the radiation reaction, the inspiral, and the wave generation. We derive all the formulas one needs to readily compute the spin-modulated gravitational waveform (within the post-Newtonian approximation and the approximation that the precession frequency is much smaller than the orbital frequency). We also develop intuition into what the modulated signals "look like," by a variety of means. We provide approximate, analytical solutions for the precessional motion and the modulated waveforms for two important special cases: the case where the bodies have nearly equal masses and the case where one of the bodies has negligible spin. For these cases, for almost all choices of binary parameters, the motion is a simple precession of the orbital angular momentum around the nearly fixed direction of the total angular momentum, with a few tens of precession periods as the waves sweep through the LIGO/VIRGO observational band. However, when the spin and orbital angular momenta are approximately anti-aligned, there is a transitional-precession epoch during which their near cancellation causes the binary to "lose its gyroscopic bearings" and tumble in space, with a corresponding peculiar sweep of the waveform modulation. We also explore numerically the precessional behaviors that occur for general masses and spins; these typically appear quite similar to our special-case, simple-precession, and transitional-precession solutions. An Appendix develops several diagrammatic aids for understanding intuitively the relation between the precessing orbit and the modulated waveform.},

  abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method’s full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.},

  abstract = {The data analysis of the gravitational wave signals emitted by coalescing neutron star binaries requires the availability of an accurate analytical representation of the dynamics and waveforms of these systems. We propose an effective-one-body (EOB) model that describes the general relativistic dynamics of neutron star binaries from the early inspiral up to merger. Our EOB model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multi-orbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semi-analytical model which captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available.},

We present also the sixth post-Newtonian (6PN) contribution to the third-post-Minkowskian (3PM) dynamics. Our strategy combines several theoretical formalisms: post-Newtonian, post-Minkowskian, multipolar-post-Minkowskian, gravitational self-force, effective one-body, and Delaunay averaging. We determine the full functional structure of the 5PN Hamiltonian (which involves 95 non-zero numerical coefficients), except for two undetermined coefficients proportional to the cube of the symmetric mass ratio, and to the fifth and sixth power of the gravitational constant, \$G\$. We present not only the 5PN-accurate, 3PM contribution to the scattering angle, but also its 6PN-accurate generalization. Both results agree with the corresponding truncations of the recent 3PM result of Bern et al. [Phys.\textbackslash{} Rev.\textbackslash{} Lett.\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash bf 122\}, 201603 (2019)]. We also compute the 5PN-accurate, fourth-post-Minkowskian (4PM) contribution to the scattering angle, including its nonlocal contribution, thereby offering checks for future 4PM calculations. We point out a remarkable hidden simplicity of the gauge-invariant functional relation between the radial action and the effective-one-body energy and angular momentum.},

  abstract = {The article reviews the current status of a theoretical approach to the problem of the emission of gravitational waves by isolated systems in the context of general relativity. Part A of the article deals with general post-Newtonian sources. The exterior field of the source is investigated by means of a combination of analytic post-Minkowskian and multipolar approximations. The physical observables in the far-zone of the source are described by a specific set of radiative multipole moments. By matching the exterior solution to the metric of the post-Newtonian source in the near-zone we obtain the explicit expressions of the source multipole moments. The relationships between the radiative and source moments involve many nonlinear multipole interactions, among them those associated with the tails (and tails-of-tails) of gravitational waves. Part B of the article is devoted to the application to compact binary systems. We present the equations of binary motion, and the associated Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order beyond the Newtonian acceleration. The gravitational-wave energy flux, taking consistently into account the relativistic corrections in the binary moments as well as the various tail effects, is derived through 3.5PN order with respect to the quadrupole formalism. The binary’s orbital phase, whose prior knowledge is crucial for searching and analyzing the signals from inspiralling compact binaries, is deduced from an energy balance argument.},

Observations of such signals are hampered by the photon shot noise of ground-based interferometers and pose a challenge for gravitational-wave astronomy. We develop an analytical time-domain waveform model for postmerger signals informed by numerical relativity simulations. The model completes effective-one-body waveforms for quasicircular nonspinning binaries in the kilohertz regime. We show that a template-based analysis can detect postmerger signals with a minimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8.5, corresponding to GW170817-like events for third-generation interferometers. Using Bayesian model selection and the complete inspiral-merger-postmerger waveform model it is possible to infer whether the merger outcome is a prompt collapse to a black hole or a remnant star. In the latter case, the radius of the maximum mass (most compact) nonrotating neutron star can be determined to kilometer precision. We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the stiffness of the equation of state at extreme densities using the quasiuniversal relations deduced from numerical-relativity simulations.},

  abstract = {The two-body dynamics in general relativity has been solved perturbatively using the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. The evolution of the orbital phase and the emitted gravitational radiation are now known to a rather high order up to O(v\^8), v being the characteristic velocity of the binary. The orbital evolution, however, cannot be specified uniquely due to the inherent freedom in the choice of parameter used in the PN expansion as well as the method pursued in solving the relevant differential equations. The goal of this paper is to determine the (dis)agreement between different PN waveform families in the context of initial and advanced gravitational-wave detectors. The waveforms employed in our analysis are those that are currently used by Initial LIGO/Virgo, that is the time-domain PN models TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt, the effective one-body (EOB) model, and the Fourier-domain representation TaylorF2. We examine the overlaps of these models with one another and with the prototype effective one-body model (calibrated to numerical relativity simulations, as currently used by initial LIGO) for a number of different binaries at 2PN, 3PN and 3.5PN orders to quantify their differences and to help us decide whether there exist preferred families that are the most appropriate as search templates. We conclude that as long as the total mass remains less than a certain upper limit M\_crit, all template families at 3.5PN order (except TaylorT3 and TaylorEt) are equally good for the purpose of detection. The value of M\_crit is found to be \textasciitilde{} 12M\_Sun for Initial, Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. From a purely computational point of view we recommend that 3.5PN TaylorF2 be used below Mcrit and EOB calibrated to numerical relativity simulations be used for total binary mass M {$>$} Mcrit.},

However, current approaches to parameter estimation for these detectors require computationally expensive algorithms. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new, fast, and accurate Bayesian inference techniques. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a reduced order modeling approach enables rapid parameter estimation to be performed. By implementing a reduced order quadrature scheme within the LIGO Algorithm Library, we show that Bayesian inference on the 9-dimensional parameter space of nonspinning binary neutron star inspirals can be sped up by a factor of ∼30 for the early advanced detectors’ configurations (with sensitivities down to around 40 Hz) and ∼70 for sensitivities down to around 20 Hz. This speedup will increase to about 150 as the detectors improve their low-frequency limit to 10 Hz, reducing to hours analyses which could otherwise take months to complete. Although these results focus on interferometric gravitational wave detectors, the techniques are broadly applicable to any experiment where fast Bayesian analysis is desirable.},

These are the dominant cost in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, which are widely employed in parameter estimation studies, and so ROQs offer a new way to accelerate GW parameter estimation. We illustrate our approach using a four-dimensional GW burst model embedded in noise. We build an ROQ for this model and perform four-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo searches with both the standard and ROQ rules, showing that, for this model, the ROQ approach is around 25 times faster than the standard approach with essentially no loss of accuracy. The speed-up from using ROQs is expected to increase for more complex GW signal models and therefore has significant potential to accelerate parameter estimation of GW sources such as compact binary coalescences.},

  abstract = {The coalescence of compact objects is one of the most promising sources, as well as the source of the first detections, of gravitational waves for ground-based interferometric detectors, such as advanced LIGO and Virgo. Generically, compact objects in binaries are expected to be spinning with spin angular momenta misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, causing the orbital plane to precess. This precession adds rich structure to the gravitational waves, introducing such complexity that an analytic closed-form description has been unavailable until now. We here construct the first closed-form frequency-domain gravitational waveforms that are valid for generic spin-precessing quasicircular compact binary inspirals. We first construct time-domain gravitational waves by solving the post-Newtonian precession equations of motion with radiation reaction through multiple scale analysis. We then Fourier transform these time-domain waveforms with the method of shifted uniform asymptotics to obtain closed-form expressions for frequency-domain waveforms. We study the accuracy of these analytic, frequency-domain waveforms relative to waveforms obtained by numerically evolving the post-Newtonian equations of motion and find that they are suitable for unbiased parameter estimation for 99.2\%(94.6\%) of the binary configurations we studied at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10(25). These new frequency-domain waveforms could be used for detection and parameter estimation studies due to their accuracy and low computational cost.},

These models are defined in the Fourier domain, thus can be used for fast matched filtering in the gravitational wave search. PhenomA has been developed for nonspinning BBH waveforms, while PhenomB and PhenomC were designed to model the waveforms of BBH systems with nonprecessing (aligned) spins, but can also be used for nonspinning systems. In this work, we study the validity of the phenomenological models for nonspinning BBH searches at low masses, \$m\_\{1,2\}\textbackslash geq 4 Msun\$ and \$m\_1+m\_2\textbackslash equiv M \textbackslash leq 30 Msun\$, with Advanced LIGO. As our complete signal waveform model, we adopt EOBNRv2 that is a time-domain inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model. To investigate the search efficiency of the phenomenological template models, we calculate fitting factors by exploring overlap surfaces. We find that only PhenomC is valid to obtain the fitting factors better than 0.97 in the mass range of \$M{$<$}15 Msun\$. Above \$15 Msun\$, PhenomA is most efficient in symmetric mass region, PhenomB is most efficient in highly asymmetric mass region, and PhenomC is most efficient in the intermediate region. Specifically, we propose an effective phenomenological template family that can be constructed by employing the phenomenological models in four subregions individually. We find that fitting factors of the effective templates are better than 0.97 in our entire mass region and mostly greater than 0.99.},

  abstract = {Astronomy with gravitational-wave observations is now a reality. Much of the theoretical research in this field falls under three broad themes: the mathematical description and physical understanding of gravitational radiation and its effects; the construction of accurate and computationally efficient waveform models for astrophysical sources; and the improved statistical analysis of noisy data from interferometric detectors, so as to extract and characterise source signals. The doctoral thesis presented in this dissertation is an investigation of various topics across these themes. Under the first theme, we examine the direct interaction between gravitational waves and electromagnetic fields in a self-contained theoretical study; this is done with a view to understanding the observational implications for highly energetic astrophysical events that radiate in both the gravitational and electromagnetic sectors. We then delve into the second theme of source modelling by developing and implementing an improved waveform model for the extreme-mass-ratio inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into supermassive black holes, which are an important class of source for future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Two separate topics are explored under the third theme of data analysis. We begin with the procedure of searching for gravitational-wave signals in detector data, and propose several combinatorial compression schemes for the large banks of waveform templates that are matched against putative signals, before studying the usefulness of these schemes for accelerating searches. After a gravitational-wave source is detected, the follow-up process is to measure its parameters in detail from the data; this is addressed as we apply the machine-learning technique of Gaussian process regression to gravitational-wave data analysis, and in particular to the formidable problem of parameter estimation for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.},

  abstract = {Matched filtering is used to search for gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling compact binaries in data from the ground-based interferometers. One of the key aspects of the detection process is the design of a template bank that covers the astrophysically pertinent parameter space. In an earlier paper, we described a template bank that is based on a square lattice. Although robust, we showed that the square placement is overefficient, with the implication that it is computationally more demanding than required. In this paper, we present a template bank based on an hexagonal lattice, which size is reduced by 40\% with respect to the proposed square placement. We describe the practical aspects of the hexagonal template bank implementation, its size, and computational cost. We have also performed exhaustive simulations to characterize its efficiency and safeness. We show that the bank is adequate to search for a wide variety of binary systems (primordial black holes, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes) and in data from both current detectors (initial LIGO, Virgo and GEO600) as well as future detectors (advanced LIGO and EGO). Remarkably, although our template bank placement uses a metric arising from a particular template family, namely, stationary phase approximation, we show that it can be used successfully with other template families (e.g., Padé resummation and effective one-body approximation). This quality of being effective for different template families makes the proposed bank suitable for a search that would use several of them in parallel (e.g., in a binary black hole search). The hexagonal template bank described in this paper is currently used to search for nonspinning inspiralling compact binaries in data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).},

BayesWave models gravitational wave signals in a morphology-independent manner through a sum of frame functions, such as Morlet-Gabor wavelets or chirplets. BayesWave models the instrument noise using a combination of a parametrized Gaussian noise component and non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise transients. Both the signal model and noise model employ trans-dimensional sampling, with the complexity of the model adapting to the requirements of the data. The flexibility of the algorithm makes it suitable for a variety of analyses, including reconstructing generic unmodeled signals; cross checks against modeled analyses for compact binaries; as well as separating coherent signals from incoherent instrumental noise transients (glitches). The BayesWave model has been extended to account for gravitational wave signals with generic polarization content and the simultaneous presence of signals and glitches in the data. We describe updates in the BayesWave prior distributions, sampling proposals, and burn-in stage that provide significantly improved sampling efficiency. We present standard review checks indicating the robustness and convergence of the BayesWave trans-dimensional sampler.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in Gravitational Wave Astronomy is identifying weak signals in the presence of non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. The separation of gravitational wave signals from noise requires good models for both. When accurate signal models are available, such as for binary Neutron star systems, it is possible to make robust detection statements even when the noise is poorly understood. In contrast, searches for "un-modeled" transient signals are strongly impacted by the methods used to characterize the noise. Here we take a Bayesian approach and introduce a multi-component, variable dimension, parameterized noise model that explicitly accounts for non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity in data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Instrumental transients (glitches) and burst sources of gravitational waves are modeled using a Morlet-Gabor continuous wavelet frame. The number and placement of the wavelets is determined by a trans-dimensional Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The Gaussian component of the noise and sharp line features in the noise spectrum are modeled using the BayesLine algorithm, which operates in concert with the wavelet model.},

We investigate how accurately the distance to the source and the masses and spins of the two bodies will be measured from the inspiral gravitational wave signals by the three-detector LIGO-VIRGO network using ‘‘advanced detectors’’ (those present a few years after initial operation). The large number of cycles in the observable waveform increases our sensitivity to those parameters that affect the inspiral rate, and thereby the evolution of the waveform’s phase. These parameters are thus measured much more accurately than parameters which affect the waveform’s polarization or amplitude. To lowest order in a post-Newtonian expansion, the evolution of the waveform’s phase depends only on the combination scrM≡(M1M2)3/5(M1+M2)−1/5 of the masses M1 and M2 of the two bodies, which is known as the ‘‘chirp mass.’’ To post-1-Newtonian order, the waveform’s phase also depends sensitively on the binary’s reduced mass μ≡M1M2/(M1+M2) allowing, in principle, a measurement of both M1 and M2 with high accuracy.},

To detect the GW signals emitted by BBHs, and measure the parameters of the source, one needs to have in hand a bank of GW templates that are both effectual (for detection), and accurate (for measurement). We study the effectualness and the accuracy of the two types of parametrized banks of templates that are directly defined in the frequency-domain by means of closed-form expressions, namely 'post-Newtonian' (PN) and 'phenomenological' models. In absence of knowledge of the exact waveforms, our study assumes as fiducial, target waveforms the ones generated by the most accurate version of the effective one body (EOB) formalism. We find that, for initial GW detectors the use, at each point of parameter space, of the best closed-form template (among PN and phenomenological models) leads to an effectualness {$>$}97\% over the entire mass range and {$>$}99\% in an important fraction of parameter space; however, when considering advanced detectors, both of the closed-form frequency-domain models fail to be effectual enough in significant domains of the two-dimensional [total mass and mass ratio] parameter space. Moreover, we find that, both for initial and advanced detectors, the two closed-form frequency-domain models fail to satisfy the minimal required accuracy standard in a very large domain of the two-dimensional parameter space. In addition, a side result of our study is the determination, as a function of the mass ratio, of the maximum frequency at which a frequency-domain PN waveform can be 'joined' onto a NR-calibrated EOB waveform without undue loss of accuracy.},

In the hope of analytically describing the gravitational wave phasing during the late inspiral (essentially up to contact) we propose an extension of the effective one body (EOB) formalism which includes tidal effects. We compare the prediction of this tidal-EOB formalism to recently computed nonconformally flat quasi-equilibrium circular sequences of binary neutron star systems. Our analysis suggests the importance of higher-order (post-Newtonian) corrections to tidal effects, even beyond the first post-Newtonian order, and their tendency to \{\textbackslash it significantly\} increase the ``effective tidal polarizability'' of neutron stars. We compare the EOB predictions to some recently advocated, nonresummed, post-Newtonian based (``Taylor-T4'') description of the phasing of inspiralling systems. This comparison shows the strong sensitivity of the late-inspiral phasing to the choice of the analytical model, but raises the hope that a sufficiently accurate numerical--relativity--``calibrated'' EOB model might give us a reliable handle on the nuclear equation of state},

  abstract = {The gravitational wave signal from a binary neutron star inspiral contains information on the nuclear equation of state. This information is contained in a combination of the tidal polarizability parameters of the two neutron stars and is clearest in the late inspiral, just before merger. We use the recently defined tidal extension of the effective one-body formalism to construct a controlled analytical description of the frequency-domain phasing of neutron star inspirals up to merger. Exploiting this analytical description we find that the tidal polarizability parameters of neutron stars can be measured by the advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network from gravitational wave signals having a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio of \$\textbackslash rho=16\$. This measurability result seems to hold for all the nuclear equations of state leading to a maximum mass larger than \$1.97M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We also propose a promising new way of extracting information on the nuclear equation of state from a coherent analysis of an ensemble of gravitational wave observations of separate binary merger events.},

  abstract = {We present a new, tunable effective-one-body (EOB) model of the motion and radiation of coalescing black hole binaries with arbitrary mass ratio and aligned spins. The most novel feature of our formalism is the introduction, and systematic use, of the (gauge-invariant) concept of \{\textbackslash it centrifugal radius\} \$r\_\{c\}\$. In the spinning small mass-ratio limit, the main radial potential expressed in terms of \$r\_\{c\}\$ differs very little (and only multiplicatively so) from the usual Schwarzschild potential \$1-2M/r\_\{c\}\$. This motivates a new, multiplicative way of blending finite-mass-ratio deformations with spin-deformations. In the present exploratory work we consider a minimal version of our spinning EOB model (containing essentially only two adjustable parameters: one in the Hamiltonian and one in the waveform) and calibrate its (dominant mode) waveform against a sample of fifteen equal-mass, equal-spin waveforms produced by the SXS collaboration, and covering the dimensionless spin range \$-0.95\textbackslash leq \textbackslash chi \textbackslash leq +0.98\$.

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

Numerical relativity simulations are the only tool to describe the binary's merger dynamics in the regime when speeds are largest and gravity is strongest. In this work we report state-of-the-art binary neutron star simulations for irrotational (non-spinning) and spinning configurations. The main use of these simulations is to model the gravitational-wave signal. Key numerical requirements are the understanding of the convergence properties of the numerical data and a detailed error budget. The simulations have been performed on different HPC clusters, they use multiple grid resolutions, and are based on eccentricity reduced quasi-circular initial data. We obtain convergent waveforms with phase errors of 0.5-1.5 rad accumulated over approximately 12 orbits to merger. The waveforms have been used for the construction of a phenomenological waveform model which has been applied for the analysis of the recent binary neutron star detection. Additionally, we show that the data can also be used to test other state-of-the-art semi-analytical waveform models.},

  abstract = {Die ersten direkten Detektionen von Gravitationswellen von verschmelzenden Schwarzen Löchern und Neutronensternen haben die Ära der Gravitationswellenastronomie eingeläutet. Seitdem ist die Beobachtung von verschmelzenden kompakten Objekten zur Routine geworden. Andere interessante Quellen von Gravitationswellen sind jedoch noch unentdeckt. Schnell rotierende Neutronensterne können schwache, langanhaltende quasi-monochromatische Wellen aussenden, genannt Kontinuierliche Gravitationswellen (engl.: continuous waves CWs). In der aktuellen Detektorgeneration, advanced LIGO und Virgo, wird mehr Detektoroutput durch diverse Rauschquellen erzeugt als durch potenzielle CW Signale. Die Datenanalyse für CWs versucht die Schwäche der Signale zu überwinden, indem die Daten über lange Zeitspan- nen integriert werden. Große Mengen von Daten zu analysieren ist jedoch für gewöhnlich mit großen Ansprüchen an die Rechenleistung verbunden. Deshalb sind Suchen nach CWs von un- bekannten Neutronensternen in ihrer Empfindlichkeit limitiert durch die begrenzt vorhandene Rechenleistung. Diese Doktorarbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem Abschätzen und Verbessern der Empfindlichkeit von Suchen nach Kontinuierlichen Gravitationswellen. Das erste Hauptforschungsergebnis dieser Arbeit ist ein neuartiger Abschätzer, der die Empfindlichkeit einer CW-Suche schnell und genau vorhersagen kann bevor die Suche gestartet wird. Dies vereinfacht die Verbesserung der Suchal- gorithmen und kann deshalb zu empfindlicheren Suchen führen. Die Genauigkeit des Abschätzers wird anhand von vielen verschiedenen CW-Suchen untersucht. Die Untersuchung wird ergänzt durch eine ausführliche Studie der Empfindlichkeit von vergangenen CW-Suchen. Dazu wird deren Empfindlichkeit in die gemeinsame Größe der Empfindlichkeitstiefe (engl.: sensitivity depth) umgerechnet. Das zweite Hauptforschungsergebnis dieser Dissertation ist eine neuartige CW-Suchmethode mit Hilfe von tiefen neuronalen Netzwerken (engl.: deep neural networks, DNNs). Fertig trainierte DNNs können extrem schnell angewendet werden und stellen deshalb eine interes- sante Art und Weise dar, wie möglicherweise mit der Limitierung durch fehlende Rechenleistung umgegangen und eine empfindlichere Suche konstruiert werden kann. In dieser Arbeit wird eine solche DNN nutzende CW-Suchmethode präsentiert: zuerst als Suche mit Daten von einem einzigen Detektor nach Signalen vom gesamten Himmel und dann erweitert zu Suchen mit Daten von mehreren Detektoren nach Signalen vom gesamten Himmel oder nach Signalen von einer speziellen Himmelsposition. Die Leistungsfähigkeit der DNNs wird dabei verglichen mit kohärenten Optimalfiltermethoden im Hinblick auf ihre Detektionswahrscheinlichkeit bei festem Fehlalarmniveau. Diese Arbeit zeigt das diesbezüglich große Potential von DNNs: Bei der Analyse von kurzen Zeitspannen von etwa einem Tag verliert das Netwerk nur wenige Prozent in Empfindlichkeitstiefe gegenüber kohärenten Optimalfiltermethoden. Für längere Zeitspannen nimmt die Leistungsfähigkeit der Netzwerke im Vergleich jedoch nach und nach ab. An dieser Stelle wird deshalb weitere Forschungsarbeit benötigt um die Leistungsfähigkeit der DNNs zu verbessern. Ein Ansatz, der in dieser Arbeit für zukünftige Forschung vorgeschlagen wird, ist die Kombination von Ergebnissen, die Netzwerke auf kurzen Zeitspannen erreicht haben, als Ergebnis für längere Zeitspannen zu nutzen. Dieser Ansatz ist ähnlich zum semi-kohärenten Optimalfilter, der in klassischen CW-Suchen benutzt wird.},

The equation of state can be further constrained if gravitational waves from a postmerger remnant are detected. Postmerger waveforms are currently generated by numerical-relativity simulations, which are computationally expensive. Here we introduce a hierarchical model trained on numerical-relativity simulations, which can generate reliable postmerger spectra in a fraction of a second. Our spectra have mean fitting factors of 0.95, which compares to a fitting factor of 0.93 between different numerical-relativity codes that simulate the same physical system. This method is the first step towards generating large template banks of spectra for use in postmerger detection and parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {The detection of \textasciitilde 50 coalescing compact binaries with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors has allowed us to test general relativity, constrain merger rates, and look for evidence of tidal effects, compact object spins, higher waveform modes, and black hole ringdowns. An effect that has not yet been confidently detected is binary eccentricity, which might be present in a small fraction of binaries formed dynamically. Here we discuss general limits on eccentricity that can, in-principle, be placed on all types of compact object binaries by a detector operating at the design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO. Using a post-Newtonian model for gravitational-wave phasing valid in the small eccentricity regime, we assess the relative measurement error for eccentricity for a variety of spinning and non-spinning binaries. Errors and correlations involving the mass and spin parameters are also investigated. We find that decreasing the low frequency limit of a detector's observational frequency band is one of the key design factors for increasing the odds of measuring binary eccentricity. We also introduce and analytically explore the eccentric chirp mass parameter, which replaces the chirp mass as the key measurable parameter combination in eccentric gravitational waveform models. The eccentric chirp mass parameter explains a degeneracy between the chirp mass and the eccentricity. This degeneracy leads to a bias in the standard chirp mass parameter. We also investigate the systematic parameter bias that arises when eccentric systems are recovered using circular waveform templates. We use both Fisher matrix and Bayesian-inference-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to investigate these parameter estimation issues, and we find good agreement between the two approaches (for both statistical and systematic errors) in the appropriate signal-to-noise ratio regime.

  abstract = {The nonlinear gravitational-wave memory causes a time-varying but nonoscillatory correction to the gravitational-wave polarizations. It arises from gravitational waves that are sourced by gravitational waves. Previous considerations of the nonlinear memory effect have focused on quasicircular binaries. Here, I consider the nonlinear memory from Newtonian orbits with arbitrary eccentricity. Expressions for the waveform polarizations and spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes are derived for elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial orbits. In the hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial cases the nonlinear memory provides a 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) correction to the leading-order waveforms. This is in contrast to the elliptical and quasicircular cases, where the nonlinear memory corrects the waveform at leading (0PN) order. This difference in PN order arises from the fact that the memory builds up over a short "scattering" time scale in the hyperbolic case, as opposed to a much longer radiation-reaction time scale in the elliptical case. The nonlinear memory corrections presented here complete our knowledge of the leading-order (Peters-Mathews) waveforms for elliptical orbits. These calculations are also relevant for binaries with quasicircular orbits in the present epoch which had, in the past, large eccentricities. Because the nonlinear memory depends sensitively on the past evolution of a binary, I discuss the effect of this early-time eccentricity on the value of the late-time memory in nearly circularized binaries. I also discuss the observability of large "memory jumps" in a binary's past that could arise from its formation in a capture process. Lastly, I provide estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio of the linear and nonlinear memories from hyperbolic and parabolic binaries.},

Numerous studies have considered the precision with which binary parameters (masses, spins, Love numbers) can be measured.

These approximations include truncation of the post-Newtonian (PN) series and neglect of neutron star (NS) spin, tidal deformation, or orbital eccentricity. All of these effects can yield systematic errors that exceed statistical errors for plausible parameter values. In particular, neglecting spin, eccentricity, or high-order PN terms causes a significant bias in the NS Love number.

  abstract = {We propose a solution to the problem of quickly and accurately predicting gravitational waveforms within any given physical model. The method is relevant for both real-time applications and more traditional scenarios where the generation of waveforms using standard methods can be prohibitively expensive. Our approach is based on three offline steps resulting in an accurate reduced order model in both parameter and physical dimensions that can be used as a surrogate for the true or fiducial waveform family. First, a set of m parameter values is determined using a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation is constructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values for interpolating a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant that is built for the fiducial waveform family. Third, a fit in the parameter dimension is performed for the waveform’s value at each of these m times. The cost of predicting L waveform time samples for a generic parameter choice is of order O(mL+mcfit) online operations, where cfit denotes the fitting function operation count and, typically, m≪L. The result is a compact, computationally efficient, and accurate surrogate model that retains the original physics of the fiducial waveform family while also being fast to evaluate. We generate accurate surrogate models for effective-one-body waveforms of nonspinning binary black hole coalescences with durations as long as 105M, mass ratios from 1 to 10, and for multiple spherical harmonic modes. We find that these surrogates are more than 3 orders of magnitude faster to evaluate as compared to the cost of generating effective-one-body waveforms in standard ways. Surrogate model building for other waveform families and models follows the same steps and has the same low computational online scaling cost. For expensive numerical simulations of binary black hole coalescences, we thus anticipate extremely large speedups in generating new waveforms with a surrogate. As waveform generation is one of the dominant costs in parameter estimation algorithms and parameter space exploration, surrogate models offer a new and practical way to dramatically accelerate such studies without impacting accuracy. Surrogates built in this paper, as well as others, are available from GWSurrogate, a publicly available python package.},

  abstract = {Ground-based gravitational wave detectors may be able to constrain the nuclear equation of state using the early, low frequency portion of the signal of detected neutron star - neutron star inspirals. In this early adiabatic regime, the influence of a neutron star's internal structure on the phase of the waveform depends only on a single parameter lambda of the star related to its tidal Love number, namely the ratio of the induced quadrupole moment to the perturbing tidal gravitational field. We analyze the information obtainable from gravitational wave frequencies smaller than a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz, where corrections to the internal-structure signal are less than 10 percent. For an inspiral of two non-spinning 1.4 solar mass neutron stars at a distance of 50 Mpc, LIGO II detectors will be able to constrain lambda to lambda {$<$} 2.0 10\^\{37\} g cm\^2 s\^2 with 90\% confidence. Fully relativistic stellar models show that the corresponding constraint on radius R for 1.4 solar mass neutron stars would be R {$<$} 13.6 km (15.3 km) for a n=0.5 (n=1.0) polytrope.},

The standard method for the detection of well modeled transient gravitational-wave signals is matched filtering. However, the computational cost of such searches in low latency will grow dramatically as the low frequency sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors improves. Convolutional neural networks provide a highly computationally efficient method for signal identification in which the majority of calculations are performed prior to data taking during a training process. We use only whitened time series of measured gravitational-wave strain as an input, and we train and test on simulated binary black hole signals in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. We show that our network can classify signal from noise with a performance that emulates that of match filtering applied to the same datasets when considering the sensitivity defined by Reciever-Operator characteristics.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of merging black hole binaries produce the most accurate gravitational waveforms. The availability of hundreds of these numerical relativity (NR) waveforms, often containing many higher spherical harmonic modes, allows one to study many aspects of gravitational waves. Amongst these are the response of data analysis pipelines, the calibration of semi-analytical models, the building of reduced-order surrogates, the estimation of the parameters of detected gravitational waves, and the composition of public catalogs of NR waveform data. The large number of generated NR waveforms consequently requires efficient data storage and handling, especially since many more waveforms will be generated at an increased rate in the forthcoming years. In addition, gravitational wave data analyses often require the NR waveforms to be interpolated and uniformly resampled at high sampling rates. Previously, this resulted in very large data files (up to \$\textbackslash sim\$ several GB) in memory-intensive operations, which is unfeasible when confronted with hundreds of multi-modal NR waveforms. To handle these challenges, we present a simple and efficient method to significantly \textbackslash emph\{compress\} the original waveform data sets while accurately reproducing the original data via spline interpolation. The method is generically applicable to relatively smooth, one-dimensional datasets and uses a greedy algorithm to determine the most relevant subset of the full data such that a spline interpolant of a specified polynomial degree will represent the original data to within a requested point-wise tolerance. We find significant compression of the original NR data sets presented here. These compressed data sets can then be evaluated fast and efficiently and resampled as desired.},

Thus, waveform models must be efficiently generated and, at the same time, be faithful from the post-Newtonian quasi-adiabatic inspiral up to the merger regime. A simple solution to this problem is to combine effective-one-body waveforms with the stationary phase approximation to obtain frequency-domain multipolar approximants valid from any low frequency to merger. We demonstrate that effective-one-body frequency-domain waveforms generated in post-adiabatic approximation are computationally competitive with current phenomenological and surrogate models, (virtually) arbitrarily long, and faithful up to merger for any binary parameter. The same method can also be used to efficiently generate intermediate mass binary black hole inspiral waveforms detectable by space-based interferometers.},

  abstract = {Gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star coalescences carry information about the star's equation of state in their tidal signatures. A major issue in the inference of the tidal parameters (or directly of the equation of state) is the systematic error introduced by the waveform approximants. We use a bottom-up approach based on gauge-invariant phase analysis and the Fisher information matrix to investigate waveform systematics and help identifying biases in parameter estimation. A mock analysis of 15 different binaries indicates that systematics in current waveform models dominate over statistical errors at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \$\{\textbackslash gtrsim\} 80\$. This implies biases in the inference of the reduced tidal parameter that are are larger than the statistical \$90\textbackslash\%\$ credible-intervals. For example, while the neutron-star radius could be constrained at \$\{\textbackslash sim\} 5\textbackslash\%\$ level at SNR 80, systematics can be at the \$\{\textbackslash sim\} 10\textbackslash\%\$ level. We apply our approach to GW170817 (SNR \$\{\textbackslash sim\}30\$) and confirm that no significant systematic effects are present. Using an optimal frequency range for the analysis, we estimate a neutron-star radius of \$12.5\^\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.8\}\textbackslash,\$km. The latter is consistent with an electromagnetic-informed prior and the recent NICER measurement. Exploring SNR \$\{\textbackslash gtrsim\}100\$ in view of third-generation detectors, we find that all the current waveform models lead to differences of at least 1-sigma in the inference of the reduced tidal parameter (for any value of the latter). We conclude that current waveform models, including those from numerical relativity, are insufficient to infer the equation of state in the loudest (and potentially most informative) events that will be observed by advanced and third generation detectors.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Using equations of motion which include terms due to spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings we evolve the orbit of a coalescing binary and use the orbit to calculate the emitted gravitational waveform. We find the spins of the bodies affect the waveform in several ways: (1) the spin terms contribute to the orbital decay of the binary, and thus to the accumulated phase of the gravitational waveform; (2) the spins cause the orbital plane to precess, which changes the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to an observer, thus causing the shape of the waveform to be modulated; (3) the spins contribute directly to the amplitude of the waveform. We discuss the size and importance of spin effects for the case of two coalescing neutron stars, and for the case of a neutron star orbiting a rapidly rotating 10M⊙ black hole.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {In this paper we review the concepts of Bayesian evidence and Bayes factors, also known as log odds ratios, and their application to model selection. The theory is presented along with a discussion of analytic, approximate and numerical techniques. Specific attention is paid to the Laplace approximation, variational Bayes, importance sampling, thermodynamic integration, and nested sampling and its recent variants. Analogies to statistical physics, from which many of these techniques originate, are discussed in order to provide readers with deeper insights that may lead to new techniques. The utility of Bayesian model testing in the domain sciences is demonstrated by presenting four specific practical examples considered within the context of signal processing in the areas of signal detection, sensor characterization, scientific model selection and molecular force characterization.},

  abstract = {The author advocates two specific mathematical notations from his popular course and joint textbook, "Concrete Mathematics". The first of these, extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for the function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.},

  abstract = {Coalescing binaries of neutron stars (NS) and black holes (BH) are one of the most important sources of gravitational waves for the upcoming network of ground based detectors. Detection and extraction of astrophysical information from gravitational-wave signals requires accurate waveform models. The Effective-One-Body and other phenomenological models interpolate between analytic results and \$10-30\$ orbit numerical relativity (NR) merger simulations. In this paper we study the accuracy of these models using new NR simulations that span \$36-88\$ orbits, with mass-ratios and black hole spins \$(q,\textbackslash chi\_\{BH\}) = (7, \textbackslash pm 0.4), (7, \textbackslash pm 0.6)\$, and \$(5, -0.9)\$. We find that: (i) the recently published SEOBNRv1 and SEOBNRv2 models of the Effective-One-Body family disagree with each other (mismatches of a few percent) for black hole spins \$\textbackslash geq 0.5\$ or \$\textbackslash leq -0.3\$, with waveform mismatch accumulating during early inspiral; (ii) comparison with numerical waveforms indicate that this disagreement is due to phasing errors of SEOBNRv1, with SEOBNRv2 in good agreement with all of our simulations; (iii) Phenomenological waveforms disagree with SEOBNRv2 over most of the NSBH binary parameter space; (iv) comparison with NR waveforms shows that most of the model's dephasing accumulates near the frequency interval where it switches to a phenomenological phasing prescription; and finally (v) both SEOBNR and post-Newtonian (PN) models are effectual for NSBH systems, but PN waveforms will give a significant bias in parameter recovery. Our results suggest that future gravitational-wave detection searches and parameter estimation efforts targeted at NSBH systems with \$q\textbackslash lesssim 7\$ and \$\textbackslash chi\_\textbackslash mathrm\{BH\} \textbackslash approx [-0.9, +0.6]\$ will benefit from using SEOBNRv2 templates. For larger black hole spins and/or binary mass-ratios, we recommend the models be further investigated as suitable NR simulations become available.},

However, this requires accurate and computationally efficient waveform models that take {$<$}1s to evaluate for use in Bayesian parameter estimation codes that perform 10\^7 - 10\^8 waveform evaluations. We present a surrogate model of a nonspinning effective-one-body waveform model with l = 2, 3, and 4 tidal multipole moments that reproduces waveforms of binary neutron star numerical simulations up to merger. The surrogate is built from compact sets of effective-one-body waveform amplitude and phase data that each form a reduced basis. We find that 12 amplitude and 7 phase basis elements are sufficient to reconstruct any binary neutron star waveform with a starting frequency of 10Hz. The surrogate has maximum errors of 3.8\% in amplitude (0.04\% excluding the last 100M before merger) and 0.043 radians in phase. The version implemented in the LIGO Algorithm Library takes \textasciitilde 0.07s to evaluate for a starting frequency of 30Hz and \textasciitilde 0.8s for a starting frequency of 10Hz, resulting in a speed-up factor of \textasciitilde 10\^3 - 10\^4 relative to the original Matlab code. This allows parameter estimation codes to run in days to weeks rather than years, and we demonstrate this with a Nested Sampling run that recovers the masses and tidal parameters of a simulated binary neutron star system.},

  abstract = {Fast and accurate waveform models are necessary for measuring the properties of inspiraling binary neutron star systems such as GW170817. We present a frequency-domain surrogate version of the aligned-spin binary neutron star waveform model using the effective one body formalism known as SEOBNRv4T. This model includes the quadrupolar and octopolar adiabatic and dynamical tides. The version presented here is improved by the inclusion of the spin-induced quadrupole moment effect, and completed by a prescription for tapering the end of the waveform to qualitatively reproduce numerical relativity simulations. The resulting model has 14 intrinsic parameters. We reduce its dimensionality by using universal relations that approximate all matter effects in terms of the leading quadrupolar tidal parameters. The implementation of the time-domain model can take up to an hour to evaluate using a starting frequency of 20Hz, and this is too slow for many parameter estimation codes that require \$O(10\^7)\$ sequential waveform evaluations. We therefore construct a fast and faithful frequency-domain surrogate of this model using Gaussian process regression. The resulting surrogate has a maximum mismatch of \$4.5\textbackslash times 10\^\{-4\}\$ for the Advanced LIGO detector, and requires 0.13s to evaluate for a waveform with a starting frequency of 20Hz. Finally, we perform an end-to-end test of the surrogate with a set of parameter estimation runs, and find that the surrogate accurately recovers the parameters of injected waveforms.},

Love tensors characterize the tidal deformability of compact objects such as astrophysical (Kerr) black holes under an external static tidal field. We prove that all Love tensors vanish identically for a Kerr black hole in the nonspinning limit or for an axisymmetric tidal perturbation. In contrast to this result, we show that Love tensors are generically nonzero for a spinning black hole. Specifically, to linear order in the Kerr black hole spin and the weak perturbing tidal field, we compute in closed form the Love tensors that couple the mass-type and current-type quadrupole moments to the electric-type and magnetic-type quadrupolar tidal fields. For a dimensionless spin ∼0.1, the nonvanishing quadrupolar Love tensors are ∼2×10−3, thus showing that black holes are particularly “rigid” compact objects.},

  abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0×10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1σ. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160−180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03−0.04. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36+5−4M⊙ and 29+4−4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62+4−4M⊙, with 3.0+0.5−0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract = {The objective of the study is to investigate the range of gravitational redshifts which can be expected in the observation of emission lines originating near the surface of neutron stars. The approach used here to derive bounds on the gravitational redshifts from neutron stars is analogous to the methods developed by Hartle (1978) to derive bounds on the masses and moments of inertia for neutron stars. It is assumed that general relativity correctly describes the gravitational interaction at neutron star densities and that the stars are nonrotating, spherical, and composed of fluid matter (i.e., matter having isotropic stresses). For 1.4-solar-mass stars, the limits on the gravitational redshift are estimated at 0.854-0.184. These limits are compared with redshifts deduced from gamma-ray burst observations.},

This paper derives accuracy standards for model waveforms which are sufficient to ensure that these data analysis applications are capable of extracting the full scientific content of the data, but without demanding excessive accuracy that would place undue burdens on the model waveform simulation community. These accuracy standards are intended primarily for broad-band model waveforms produced by numerical simulations, but the standards are quite general and apply equally to such waveforms produced by analytical or hybrid analytical-numerical methods.},

The Toolkit, developed by a collaboration involving researchers from multiple institutions around the world, combines a core set of components needed to simulate astrophysical objects such as black holes, compact objects, and collapsing stars, as well as a full suite of analysis tools. The Einstein Toolkit is currently based on the Cactus Framework for high-performance computing and the Carpet adaptive mesh refinement driver. It implements spacetime evolution via the BSSN evolution system and general-relativistic hydrodynamics in a finite-volume discretization. The toolkit is under continuous development and contains many new code components that have been publicly released for the first time and are described in this article. We discuss the motivation behind the release of the toolkit, the philosophy underlying its development, and the goals of the project. A summary of the implemented numerical techniques is included, as are results of numerical test covering a variety of sample astrophysical problems.},

We show numerically that the maximum value of the spin parameter of a neutron star rotating at the Keplerian frequency is jmax ∼ 0.7 for a wide class of realistic equations of state. This upper bound is insensitive to the mass of the neutron star if the mass of the star is larger than about 1 M☉. On the other hand, the spin parameter of a quark star modeled by the MIT bag model can be larger than unity and does not have a universal upper bound. Its value also depends strongly on the bag constant and the mass of the star. Astrophysical implications of our finding will be discussed.},

The second volume also includes a detailed discussion of the first direct detections of gravitational waves. In the author's typical style, the theoretical results are generally derived afresh, clarifying or streamlining the existing derivations whenever possible, and providing a coherent and consistent picture of the field. The first volume of Gravitational Waves , which appeared in 2007, has established itself as the standard reference in the field. The scientific community has eagerly awaited this second volume. The recent direct detection of gravitational waves makes the topics in this book particularly timely.},

We show that the model can replicate the features of these standardsignal classes and, in addition, produce generalised burst signals through interpolationand class mixing. We also present an example application where a convolutional neuralnetwork classifier is trained on burst signals generated by our conditional generativeadversarial network. We show that a convolutional neural network classifier trainedonly on the standard five signal classes has a poorer detection efficiency than aconvolutional neural network classifier trained on a population of generalised burstsignals drawn from the combined signal class space.},

  abstract = {We derive a point-mass (nonspinning) frequency-domain TaylorF2 phasing approximant at quasi-5.5 post-Newtonian (PN) accuracy for the gravitational wave from coalescing compact binaries. The new approximant is obtained by Taylor-expanding the effective-one-body (EOB) resummed energy and and angular momentum flux along circular orbits with all the known test-particle information up to 5.5PN. The -- yet uncalculated -- terms at 4PN order and beyond entering both the energy flux and the energy are taken into account as free parameters and then set to zero. We compare the quasi-5.5PN and 3.5PN approximants against full EOB waveforms using gauge-invariant phasing diagnostics \$Q\_\textbackslash omega=\textbackslash hat\textbackslash omega\^2/\textbackslash dot\{\textbackslash hat\textbackslash omega\}\$, where \$\textbackslash hat\textbackslash omega\$ is the dimensionless gravitational-wave frequency. The quasi-5.5PN phasing is found to be systematically closer to the EOB one than the 3.5PN one. Notably, the quasi-5.5PN (3.5PN) approximant accumulates a EOB\$-\$PN dephasing of \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Psi\^\{\textbackslash rm EOBPN\}\textbackslash sim10\^\{-3\}\$rad (\$0.13\$rad) up to frequency \$\textbackslash hat\textbackslash omega \textbackslash simeq 0.06\$, 6 orbits to merger, (\$\textbackslash hat\textbackslash omega \textbackslash simeq 0.086\$, 2 orbits to merger) for a fiducial binary neutron star system. We explore the performance of the quasi-5.5PN approximant on the measurement of the tidal polarizability parameter \$\textbackslash tilde\textbackslash Lambda\$ using injections of EOB waveforms hybridized with numerical relativity merger waveforms. We prove that the quasi-5.5PN point-mass approximant augmented with 6PN-accurate tidal terms allows one to reduce (and in many cases even eliminate) the biases in the measurement of \$\textbackslash tilde\textbackslash Lambda\$ that are instead found when the standard 3.5PN point-mass baseline is used. Methodologically, we demonstrate that the combined use of \$Q\_\textbackslash omega\$ analysis and of the Bayesian parameter estimation offers a new tool to investigate the impact of systematics on gravitational-wave inference.},

  abstract = {Although the gravitational waves observed by advanced LIGO and Virgo are consistent with compact binaries in a quasi-circular inspiral prior to coalescence, eccentric inspirals are also expected to occur in Nature. Due to their complexity, we currently lack ready-to-use, analytic waveforms in the Fourier domain valid for sufficiently high eccentricity, and such models are crucial to coherently extract weak signals from the noise. We here take the first steps to derive and properly validate an analytic waveform model in the Fourier domain that is valid for inspirals of arbitrary orbital eccentricity. As a proof-of-concept, we build this model to leading post-Newtonian order by combining the stationary phase approximation, a truncated sum of harmonics, and an analytic representation of hypergeometric functions. Through comparisons with numerical post-Newtonian waveforms, we determine how many harmonics are required for a faithful (matches above 99\%) representation of the signal up to orbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. As a first byproduct of this analysis, we present a novel technique to maximize the match of eccentric signals over time of coalescence and phase at coalescence. As a second byproduct, we determine which of the different approximations we employ leads to the largest loss in match, which could be used to systematically improve the model because of our analytic control. The future extension of this model to higher post-Newtonian order will allow for an accurate and fast phenomenological hybrid that can account for arbitrary eccentricity inspirals and mergers.},

In many applications these models are incomplete, which both reduces the prospects of detection and leads to a systematic error in the parameter estimates. In the analysis of data from gravitational wave detectors, for example, accurate waveform templates can be computed using numerical methods, but the prohibitive cost of these simulations means this can only be done for a small handful of parameters. In this work a novel method to fold model uncertainties into data analysis is proposed; the waveform uncertainty is analytically marginalised over using with a prior distribution constructed by using Gaussian process regression to interpolate the waveform difference from a small training set of accurate templates. The method is well motivated, easy to implement, and no more computationally expensive than standard techniques. The new method is shown to perform extremely well when applied to a toy problem. While we use the application to gravitational wave data analysis to motivate and illustrate the technique, it can be applied in any context where model uncertainties exist.},

The model relies on the idea of incorporating general Newtonian prefactors, instead of the usual quasi-circular ones, in both radiation reaction and waveform. The major advance with respect to previous work is that the quasi-circular limit of the model is now correctly informed by numerical relativity (NR) quasi-circular simulation. This provides EOB/NR unfaithfulness for the dominant quadrupolar waveform, calculated with Advanced LIGO noise, at most of the order of \$1\textbackslash\%\$ over a meaningful portion of the quasi-circular NR simulations calculated by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) collaboration. In the presence of eccentricity, the model is similarly NR-faithful, \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\textbackslash\%\$, all over the 28 public SXS NR datasets, with initial eccentricity up to \$\textbackslash simeq 0.2\$ , mass ratio up to \$q=3\$ and dimensionless spin magnitudes as large as \$+0.7\$. Higher multipoles, up to \$\textbackslash ell=5\$ are also reliably modeled through the eccentric inspiral, plunge merger and ringdown. For hyperbolic-like configurations, we also show that the EOB computed scattering angle is in excellent agreement with all currently available NR results.},

  abstract = {Computationally efficient waveforms are of central importance for gravitational wave data analysis of inspiralling and coalescing compact binaries. We show that the post-adiabatic (PA) approximation to the effective-one-body (EOB) description of the binary dynamics, when pushed to high-order, allows one to accurately and efficiently compute the waveform of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) or black holes (BBHs) up to a few orbits before merger. This is accomplished bypassing the usual need of numerically solving the relative EOB dynamics described by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Under the assumption that radiation reaction is small, the Hamilton's equations for the momenta can be solved \{\textbackslash it analytically\} for given values of the relative separation. Time and orbital phase are then recovered by simple numerical quadratures. For the least-adiabatic BBH case, equal-mass, quasi-extremal spins anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, 6PA/8PA orders are able to generate waveforms that accumulate less than \$10\^\{-3\}\$ rad of phase difference with respect to the complete EOB ones up to \$\textbackslash sim 3\$ orbits before merger. Analogous results hold for BNSs. The PA waveform generation is extremely efficient: for a standard BNS system from 10Hz, a nonoptimized Matlab implementation of the TEOBResumS EOB model in the PA approximation is more than 100 times faster (\$\textbackslash sim 0.09\$ sec) than the corresponding \$C\^\{++\}\$ code based on a standard ODE solver. Once optimized further, our approach will allow to: (i) avoid the use of the fast, but often inaccurate, post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms, drastically reducing the impact of systematics due to inspiral waveform modelling; (ii) alleviate the need of constructing EOB waveform surrogates to be used in parameter estimation codes.},

The point-mass sector through merger and ringdown is informed by numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black holes (BBH) computed with the SpEC and BAM codes. An improved, NR-based phenomenological description of the postmerger waveform is developed.The tidal sector of TEOBResumS describes the dynamics of neutron star binaries up to merger and incorporates a resummed attractive potential motivated by recent advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. Equation-of-state dependent self-spin interactions (monopole-quadrupole effects) are incorporated in the model using leading-order post-Newtonian results in a new expression of the centrifugal radius.

We develop a new procedure to match the precession dynamics computed by post-Newtonian (PN) theory to those of numerical binary black-hole simulations in full general relativity. For numerical relativity (NR) simulations lasting approximately two precession cycles, we find that the PN and NR predictions for the directions of the orbital angular momentum and the spins agree to better than ∼1° with NR during the inspiral, increasing to 5° near merger. Nutation of the orbital plane on the orbital time scale agrees well between NR and PN, whereas nutation of the spin direction shows qualitatively different behavior in PN and NR. We also examine how the PN equations for precession and orbital-phase evolution converge with PN order, and we quantify the impact of various choices for handling partially known PN terms.},

The templates are characterized by several parameters which vary continuously over some finite range; but because the amount of computing power available to perform the cross-correlations of the search templates with the output is finite, the actual templates used must be picked with certain discrete values of these parameters, which will have some finite spacing. If the spacing is too small, the number of templates (and therefore the computing power) needed to perform an on-line search becomes prohibitive; if the spacing is too large, many chirps will not be detected because the values of their parameters lie too far from those of the nearest template. In this paper I use differential geometry to extend the earlier formalism of Sathyaprakash and Dhurandhar to estimate the template spacing, number of templates, and computing power required for a single-pass, on-line search of the output of a single interferometer in terms of the fraction of events lost to parameter discretization. My formalism obtains these results with little numerical computation, and is valid for arbitrary noise spectra and template parameterizations. I find that the computing power needed for the most computationally intensive, reasonable search is of order several hundred Gigaflops. This will be feasible by the time LIGO is operational, but it is worth pursuing methods of reducing this number.},

On the purpose of challenging these problems, we propose a new surrogate-based multiobjective optimization algorithm that does not require a large evaluation budget. It is called Multiobjective Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) and is an extension of the tree-structured Parzen estimator widely used to solve expensive single-objective optimization problems. Our empirical evidences reveal that MOTPE can approximate Pareto fronts of many benchmark problems better than existing methods with a limited budget. In this paper, we discuss furthermore the influence of MOTPE configurations to understand its behavior.},

  abstract = {Future third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will have unprecedented sensitivities enabling studies of the entire population of stellar mass binary black hole coalescences in the universe, while the A+ and Voyager upgrades to current detectors will significantly improve over advanced LIGO and Virgo design sensitivities. To infer binary parameters from a GW signal we require accurate models of the gravitational waveform as a function of black hole masses, spins, etc. Such waveform models are built from numerical relativity (NR) simulations and/or semianalytical expressions in the inspiral. We investigate the limits of the current waveform models and study at what detector sensitivity these models will yield unbiased parameter inference for loud “golden” binary black hole systems, what biases we can expect beyond these limits, and what implications such biases will have for GW astrophysics. For 3G detectors we find that the mismatch error for semianalytical models needs to be reduced by at least three orders of magnitude and for NR waveforms by one order of magnitude. We show that typical biases in units of standard deviations for the mass-ratio and effective aligned-spin will be of order unity for 2G design sensitivity and will reach several tens for 3G networks. In addition, we show that for a population of one hundred high mass precessing binary black holes, measurement errors sum up to a sizable population bias, about 10–30 times larger than the sum of 90\% credible intervals for chirp mass, mass-ratio, effective aligned, and precessing spin parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the residual signal between the GW data recorded by a detector and the best fit template waveform obtained by parameter inference analyses can have significant signal-to-noise ratio and can lead to Bayes factors as high as 1011 between a coherent and an incoherent wavelet model for the population events. This coherent power left in the residual could lead to the observation of erroneous deviations from general relativity. To address these issues and be ready to reap the scientific benefits of 3G GW detectors in the 2030s, waveform models that are significantly more physically complete and accurate need to be developed in the next decade along with major advances in efficiency and accuracy of NR codes.},

Reduced order modeling and reduced order quadrature integration rule have recently been exploited as promising techniques that can greatly reduce parameter estimation computational costs.

Phase transitions and extra degrees of freedom can emerge at densities beyond those reached during the inspiral, and typically result in a softening of the equation of state (EOS). We show that such physical effects change the qualitative dynamics of the remnant evolution, but they are not identifiable as a signature in the GW frequency, with the exception of possible black-hole formation effects. The EOS softening is, instead, encoded in the GW luminosity and phase and is in principle detectable up to distances of the order of several Mpcs with advanced detectors and up to hundreds of Mpcs with third generation detectors. Probing extreme-density matter will require going beyond the current paradigm and developing a more holistic strategy for modeling and analyzing postmerger GW signals.},

  abstract = {The use of effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms for black hole binaries analysis in gravitational-wave astronomy requires faithful models and fast generation times. A key aspect to achieve faithfulness is the inclusion of numerical-relativity (NR) informed next-to-quasicircular corrections(NQC), dependent on the radial momentum, to the waveform and radiation reaction. A robust method to speed up the waveform generation is the post-adiabatic iteration to approximate the solution of the EOB Hamiltonian equations. In this work, we assess the performances of a fast NQC prescription in combination to the post-adiabatic method for generating multipolar gravitational waves. The outlined approach allows a consistent treatment of NQC in both the waveform and the radiation-reaction, does not require iterative procedures to achieve high faithfulness, and can be efficiently employed for parameter estimation. Comparing to 611 NR simulations, for total mass \$10M\_\textbackslash odot\textbackslash leq M \textbackslash leq 200M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and using the Advanded LIGO noise, the model has EOB/NR unfaithfulness well below \$0.01\$, with 78.5\textbackslash\% of the cases below \$0.001\$. We apply the model to the parameter estimation of GW150914 exploring the impact of the new NQC and of the higher modes up to \$\textbackslash ell=m=8\$.},

One relatively new tool to search for gravitational wave signals in detector data are machine learning algorithms that utilize deep neuralnnetworks. The first successful application was able to differentiate time series strain data that contains a gravitational wave from a binary black hole merger from data that consists purely of noise. This work expands the analysis to signals from binary neutron star mergers, where a rapid detection is most valuable, as electromagnetic counterparts might otherwise be missed or not observed for long enough. We showcase many different architecture, discuss what choices improved the sensitivity of our search and introduce a new multi-rate approach. We find that the final algorithm gives state of the art performance in comparison to other search pipelines that use deep neural networks. On the other hand we also conclude that our analysis is not yet able to achieve sensitivities that are on par with template based searches. We report our results at false alarm rates down to \textasciitilde 30 samples/month which has not been tested by other neural network algorithms. We hope to provide information about useful architectural choices and improve our algorithm in the future to achieve sensitivities and false alarm rates that rival matched filtering based approaches on.},

The post-Newtonian computations of the explicit analytic dynamics and motion of compact binaries are discussed within the most often applied Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. The obtention of autonomous Hamiltonians is achieved by the transition to Routhians. Order reduction of higher derivative Hamiltonians results in standard Hamiltonians. Tetrad representation of general relativity is introduced for the tackling of compact binaries with spinning components. Configurations are treated where the absolute values of the spin vectors can be considered constant. Compact objects are modeled by use of Dirac delta functions and their derivatives. Consistency is achieved through transition to d-dimensional space and application of dimensional regularization. At the fourth post-Newtonian level, tail contributions to the binding energy show up. The conservative spin-dependent dynamics finds explicit presentation in Hamiltonian form through next-to-next-to-leading-order spin-orbit and spin1-spin2 couplings and to leading-order in the cubic and quartic in spin interactions. The radiation reaction dynamics is presented explicitly through the third-and-half post-Newtonian order for spinless objects, and, for spinning bodies, to leading-order in the spin-orbit and spin1-spin2 couplings.

  abstract = {We apply machine learning methods to build a time-domain model for gravitational waveforms from binary black hole mergers, called mlgw. The dimensionality of the problem is handled by representing the waveform's amplitude and phase using a principal component analysis. We train mlgw on about \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^3)\$ TEOBResumS and SEOBNRv4 effective-one-body waveforms with mass ratios \$q\textbackslash in[1,20]\$ and aligned dimensionless spins \$s\textbackslash in[-0.80,0.95]\$. The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at the \$\{\textbackslash sim\}10\^\{-3\}\$ level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by third-generation detectors. Future applications include the analysis of waveform systematics and model selection in parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by generic black-hole binaries show a rich structure that directly reflects the complex dynamics introduced by the precession of the orbital plane, which poses a real challenge to the development of generic waveform models. Recent progress in modelling these signals relies on an approximate decoupling between the nonprecessing secular inspiral and a precession-induced rotation. However, the latter depends in general on all physical parameters of the binary which makes modelling efforts as well as understanding parameter-estimation prospects prohibitively complex. Here we show that the dominant precession effects can be captured by a reduced set of spin parameters. Specifically, we introduce a single effective precession spin parameter, χp, which is defined from the spin components that lie in the orbital plane at some (arbitrary) instant during the inspiral. We test the efficacy of this parameter by considering binary inspiral configurations specified by the physical parameters of a corresponding nonprecessing-binary configuration (total mass, mass ratio, and spin components (anti)parallel to the orbital angular momentum), plus the effective precession spin applied to the larger black hole. We show that for an overwhelming majority of random precessing configurations, the precession dynamics during the inspiral are well approximated by our equivalent configurations. Our results suggest that in the comparable-mass regime waveform models with only three spin parameters faithfully represent generic waveforms, which has practical implications for the prospects of GW searches, parameter estimation and the numerical exploration of the precessing-binary parameter space.},

  abstract = {The first neutron star (NS) merger observed by advanced LIGO and Virgo, GW170817, and its fireworks of electromagnetic counterparts across the entire electromagnetic spectrum marked the beginning of multi-messenger astronomy and astrophysics with gravitational waves. The ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared emission was consistent with being powered by the radioactive decay of nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta by the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). Starting from an outline of the inferred properties of this 'kilonova' emission, I discuss possible astrophysical sites for r-process nucleosynthesis in NS mergers, arguing that the heaviest r-process elements synthesized in this event most likely originated in outflows from a post-merger accretion disk. I compare the inferred properties of r-process element production in GW170817 to current observational constraints on galactic heavy r-process nucleosynthesis and discuss challenges merger-only models face in explaining the r-process content of our galaxy. Based on the observational properties of GW170817 and recent theoretical progress on r-process nucleosynthesis in collapsars, I then show how GW170817 points to collapsars as the dominant source of r-process enrichment in the Milky Way. These rare core-collapse events arguably better satisfy existing constraints and overcome problems related to r-process enrichment in various environments that NS mergers face. Finally, I comment on the universality of the r-process and on how variations in light r-process elements can be obtained both in NS mergers and collapsars.},

This book attempts to remedy the situation by expounding a logical and unified approach to the whole subject of data analysis.  This text is intended as a tutorial guide for senior undergraduates and research students in science and engineering. After explaining the basic principles of Bayesian probability theory, their use is illustrated with a variety of examples ranging from elementary parameter estimation to image processing. Other topics covered include reliability analysis, multivariate optimization, least-squares and maximum likelihood, error-propagation, hypothesis testing, maximum entropy and experimental design.  The Second Edition of this successful tutorial book contains a new chapter on extensions to the ubiquitous least-squares procedure, allowing for the straightforward handling of outliers and unknown correlated noise, and a cutting-edge contribution from John Skilling on a novel numerical technique for Bayesian computation called 'nested sampling'.},

  abstract = {Nested sampling estimates directly how the likelihood function relates to prior mass. The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic re-labelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

  abstract = {Inferring astrophysical information from gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries is one of the key science goals of gravitational-wave astronomy. In order to reach the full scientific potential of gravitational-wave experiments we require techniques to mitigate the cost of Bayesian inference, especially as gravitational-wave signal models and analyses become increasingly sophisticated and detailed. Reduced order models (ROMs) of gravitational waveforms can significantly reduce the computational cost of inference by removing redundant computations. In this paper we construct the first reduced order models of gravitational-wave signals that include the effects of spin-precession, inspiral, merger, and ringdown in compact object binaries, and which are valid for component masses describing binary neutron star, binary black hole and mixed binary systems. This work utilizes the waveform model known as "IMRPhenomPv2". Our ROM enables the use of a fast reduced order quadrature (ROQ) integration rule which allows us to approximate Bayesian probability density functions at a greatly reduced computational cost. We find that the ROQ rule can be used to speed up inference by factors as high as 300 without introducing systematic bias. This corresponds to a reduction in computational time from around half a year to a half a day, for the longest duration/lowest mass signals. The ROM and ROQ rule are available with the main inference library of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, LALInference.},

Complete analytical coalescence waveforms are currently available only for the nonprecessing binary systems. In this paper we introduce complete phenomenological waveforms for the dominant quadrupolar mode of generically spinning systems. These waveforms are constructed by bridging the gap between the analytically known inspiral phase, described by spin Taylor (T4) approximants in the restricted waveform approximation, and the ringdown phase through a phenomenological intermediate phase, calibrated by comparison with specific, numerically generated waveforms, describing equal mass systems with dimension-less spin magnitudes equal to 0.6. The overlap integral between numerical and phenomenological waveforms ranges between 0.95 and 0.99.},

A model was formulated using relativistic terms, both secular and periodically varying with orbital phase, and it was assumed that the pulsar is an accurate clock. Tests were made to determine the magnitude of possible systematic biases. The component masses and absolute size of the orbit were determined. These values were used, together with the well-determined orbital period and eccentricity, to calculate the rate at which the orbital period should decay as energy is lost from the system via gravitational radiation. The results agreed strikingly with general relativity but disagreed with most other theories of gravitation. For this reason, the companion star must be a neutron star or black hole.},

  abstract = {On 17 August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo observatories made the first direct detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary system. The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of the defining function p(ρ) of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO and Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star radii as R1=10.8+2.0−1.7 km for the heavier star and R2=10.7+2.1−1.5 km for the lighter star at the 90\% credible level. If we additionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with masses larger than 1.97 M⊙ as required from electromagnetic observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further constrain R1=11.9+1.4−1.4 km and R2=11.9+1.4−1.4 km at the 90\% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on p(ρ) at supranuclear densities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at 3.5+2.7−1.7×1034 dyn cm−2 at the 90\% level.},

  abstract = {We present a search for continuous gravitational waves from five radio pulsars, comprising three recycled pulsars (PSR J0437-4715, PSR J0711-6830, and PSR J0737-3039A) and two young pulsars: the Crab pulsar (J0534+2200) and the Vela pulsar (J0835-4510). We use data from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo combined with data from their first and second observing runs. For the first time we are able to match (for PSR J0437-4715) or surpass (for PSR J0711-6830) the indirect limits on gravitational-wave emission from recycled pulsars inferred from their observed spin-downs, and constrain their equatorial ellipticities to be less than \$10\^\{-8\}\$. For each of the five pulsars, we perform targeted searches that assume a tight coupling between the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signal phase evolution. We also present constraints on PSR J0711-6830, the Crab pulsar and the Vela pulsar from a search that relaxes this assumption, allowing the gravitational-wave signal to vary from the electromagnetic expectation within a narrow band of frequencies and frequency derivatives.},

  abstract = {On 2019 April 25, the LIGO Livingston detector observed a compact binary coalescence with signal-to-noise ratio 12.9. The Virgo detector was also taking data that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, but were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90\% credible intervals for the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ (1.45 to 1.88 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be smaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual binary components being neutron stars. However, both the source-frame chirp mass \$1.44\^\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.02\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and the total mass \$3.4\^\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.1\}\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ of this system are significantly larger than those of any other known binary neutron star system. The possibility that one or both binary components of the system are black holes cannot be ruled out from gravitational-wave data. We discuss possible origins of the system based on its inconsistency with the known Galactic binary neutron star population. Under the assumption that the signal was produced by a binary neutron star coalescence, the local rate of neutron star mergers is updated to \$250-2810 \textbackslash text\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash text\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$.},

  abstract = {On August 17, 2017, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors observed a low-mass compact binary inspiral. The initial sky localization of the source of the gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, allowed electromagnetic observatories to identify NGC 4993 as the host galaxy. In this work, we improve initial estimates of the binary's properties, including component masses, spins, and tidal parameters, using the known source location, improved modeling, and recalibrated Virgo data. We extend the range of gravitational-wave frequencies considered down to 23 Hz, compared to 30 Hz in the initial analysis. We also compare results inferred using several signal models, which are more accurate and incorporate additional physical effects as compared to the initial analysis. We improve the localization of the gravitational-wave source to a 90\% credible region of \$16\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{deg\}\^2\$. We find tighter constraints on the masses, spins, and tidal parameters, and continue to find no evidence for nonzero component spins. The component masses are inferred to lie between 1.00 and 1.89 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ when allowing for large component spins, and to lie between 1.16 and 1.60 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (with a total mass \$2.73\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.01\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$) when the spins are restricted to be within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Under minimal assumptions about the nature of the compact objects, our constraints for the tidal deformability parameter \$\textbackslash tilde \textbackslash Lambda\$ are \$(0,630)\$ when we allow for large component spins, and \$300\^\{+420\}\_\{-230\}\$ (using a 90\% highest posterior density interval) when restricting the magnitude of the component spins, ruling out several equation-of-state models at the 90\% credible level. Finally, with LIGO and GEO600 data, we use a Bayesian analysis to place upper limits on the amplitude and spectral energy density of a possible post-merger signal. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {We present our current best estimate of the plausible observing scenarios for the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors over the next several years, with the intention of providing information to facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We estimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals for the third (O3), fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including the planned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source for gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary systems of compact objects, that is BNS, NSBH, and BBH systems. The ability to localize the sources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comoving volume. The median sky localization area (90\textbackslash\% credible region) is expected to be a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3 with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization area will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. We evaluate sensitivity and localization expectations for unmodeled signal searches, including the search for intermediate mass black hole binary mergers.},

  abstract = {It is shown analytically that an external tidal gravitational field increases the secular stability of a fully general relativistic, rigidly rotating neutron star that is near marginal stability, protecting it against gravitational collapse. This stabilization is shown to result from the simple fact that the energy \$\textbackslash delta M(Q,R)\$ required to raise a tide on such a star, divided by the square of the tide's quadrupole moment \$Q\$, is a decreasing function of the star's radius \$R\$, \$(d/dR)[\textbackslash delta M(Q,R)/Q\^2]{$<$}0\$ (where, as \$R\$ changes, the star's structure is changed in accord with the star's fundamental mode of radial oscillation). If \$(d/dR)[\textbackslash delta M(Q,R)/Q\^2]\$ were positive, the tidal coupling would destabilize the star. As an application, a rigidly rotating, marginally secularly stable neutron star in an inspiraling binary system will be protected against secular collapse, and against dynamical collapse, by tidal interaction with its companion. The ``local-asymptotic-rest-frame'' tools used in the analysis are somewhat unusual and may be powerful in other studies of neutron stars and black holes interacting with an external environment. As a byproduct of the analysis, in an appendix the influence of tidal interactions on mass-energy conservation is elucidated.},

  abstract = {The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave (GW) detectors will begin operation in the coming years, with compact binary coalescence events a likely source for the first detections. The gravitational waveforms emitted directly encode information about the sources, including the masses and spins of the compact objects. Recovering the physical parameters of the sources from the GW observations is a key analysis task. This work describes the LALInference software library for Bayesian parameter estimation of compact binary signals, which builds on several previous methods to provide a well-tested toolkit which has already been used for several studies. We show that our implementation is able to correctly recover the parameters of compact binary signals from simulated data from the advanced GW detectors. We demonstrate this with a detailed comparison on three compact binary systems: a binary neutron star, a neutron star–black hole binary and a binary black hole, where we show a cross comparison of results obtained using three independent sampling algorithms. These systems were analyzed with nonspinning, aligned spin and generic spin configurations respectively, showing that consistent results can be obtained even with the full 15-dimensional parameter space of the generic spin configurations. We also demonstrate statistically that the Bayesian credible intervals we recover correspond to frequentist confidence intervals under correct prior assumptions by analyzing a set of 100 signals drawn from the prior. We discuss the computational cost of these algorithms, and describe the general and problem-specific sampling techniques we have used to improve the efficiency of sampling the compact binary coalescence parameter space.},

This cost will increase further as low frequency sensitivity in later second and third generation detectors motivates the use of longer waveforms. We describe a method for accelerating parameter estimation by exploiting the chirping behaviour of the signals to sample the waveform sparsely for portions where the full frequency resolution is not required. We demonstrate that the method can reproduce the original results with a waveform mismatch of \$\textbackslash leq 5\textbackslash times 10\^\{-7\}\$, but with a waveform generation cost up to \$\textbackslash sim 50\$ times lower for computationally costly frequency-domain waveforms starting from below 8 Hz.},

However, there should be ``gravitational self-force'' corrections to geodesic motion, analogous to the ``radiation reaction forces'' that occur in electrodynamics. It is of considerable importance to be able to calculate these self-force corrections in order to be able to determine such effects as inspiral motion in the extreme mass ratio limit. However, severe difficulties arise if one attempts to consider point particles in the context of general relativity. This article describes these difficulties and how they have been dealt with.},

  abstract = {In his 1916 ground-breaking general relativity paper Einstein had imposed a restrictive coordinate condition, his field equations were valid for coordinate systems which are unimodular. Later, Einstein published a paper on gravitational waves. The solution presented in this paper did not satisfy the above restrictive condition. In his gravitational waves paper, Einstein concluded that gravitational fields propagate at the speed of light. The solution is the Minkowski flat metric plus a small disturbance propagating in a flat spacetime. Einstein calculated the small deviation from Minkowski metric in a manner analogous to that of retarded potentials in electrodynamics. However, in obtaining the above derivation, Einstein made a mathematical error. This error caused him to obtain three different types of waves compatible with his approximate field equations: longitudinal waves, transverse waves and a new type of wave. Einstein added an Addendum in which he suggested that in systems in unimodular coordinates only waves of the third type occur and these waves transport energy. He became obsessed with his unimodular coordinates. Einstein's colleagues demonstrated to him that in the coordinate system in unimodular coordinates the gravitational wave of a mass point carry no energy, but Einstein tried to persuade them that he had actually not made a mistake in his gravitational waves paper. Einstein, however, eventually accepted his colleagues results and dropped the restrictive unimodular coordinates. This finally led him to discover plane transverse gravitational waves.},

  abstract = {We present relativistic analyses of 9257 measurements of times-of-arrival from the first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16, acquired over the last thirty-five years. The determination of the 'Keplerian' orbital elements plus two relativistic terms completely characterizes the binary system, aside from an unknown rotation about the line of sight; leading to a determination of the masses of the pulsar and its companion: 1.438 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.001 solar masses and 1.390 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.001 solar masses, respectively. In addition, the complete system characterization allows the creation of tests of relativistic gravitation by comparing measured and predicted sizes of various relativistic phenomena. We find that the ratio of observed orbital period decrease due to gravitational wave damping (corrected by a kinematic term) to the general relativistic prediction, is 0.9983 pm 0.0016; thereby confirming the existence and strength of gravitational radiation as predicted by general relativity. For the first time in this system, we have also successfully measured the two parameters characterizing the Shapiro gravitational propagation delay, and find that their values are consistent with general relativistic predictions. We have also measured for the first time in any system the relativistic shape correction to the elliptical orbit, \$\textbackslash delta\_\{\textbackslash theta\}\$,although its intrinsic value is obscured by currently unquantified pulsar emission beam aberration. We have also marginally measured the time derivative of the projected semimajor axis, which, when improved in combination with beam aberration modelling from geodetic precession observations, should ultimately constrain the pulsar's moment of inertia.},
