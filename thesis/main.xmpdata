\Subject{The analysis of interferometric data corresponding to the gravitational waves emitted in a binary neutron star merger requires the generation of numerous theoretical waveforms.
In this thesis I develop a machine learning algorithm trained on frequency-domain waveforms generated through the effective one-body technique, which is able to reconstruct them accurately and with a speed improvement.}
